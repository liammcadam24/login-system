# login-system
A basic [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) login & registration system that will progressivly be updated with more advanced features.

As a new developer to back-end systems I've decided to go with Node to see what I can create out of it rather than php. This is a very basic system that's not intended to be used on any website. In future the repository will be updated and hopefully in a more secure state with more packed featured.

### TODO
* Proper registration validation
* Secure password encryption
* Modifying account details (username, password, email)

#### Will eventually get round to adding (maybe)
* Profile pages
* Email verification
